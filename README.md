# Northwind Traders Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Northwind Traders Analysis Project**! This project delves into an extensive analysis of the Northwind Traders dataset, focusing on SQL-based data manipulation, performance metrics, sales trends, and customer behavior insights.

## Project Overview

In this project, I used SQL to explore and analyze Northwind Traders data, a fictional company with a rich dataset that mimics real-world business operations. My analysis focused on identifying key business insights, customer patterns, and operational efficiencies. Below are the major sections of analysis and the insights uncovered.

### Key Analyses and Queries

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Identified errors in phone numbers and updated them to ensure accurate contact information.

2. **Product and Supplier Analysis**:
   - **Discontinued Products**: Identified products that were discontinued yet still in stock, revealing patterns in seasonal ordering.
   - **Supplier Relationships**: Analyzed suppliers that are still active, along with the number of products sourced from each.

3. **Employee Performance**:
   - Measured employee performance by analyzing order counts, age, and years of service. For example, Margaret was identified as the top-performing employee, with 6 years of service and the highest order count.

4. **Customer Insights**:
   - **Top Cities for Orders**: Ranked cities based on total order volume, highlighting key markets.
   - **New Customers**: Identified customers who made their first purchase in the last six months.
   - **Engaged but Non-purchasing Customers**: Listed customers who inquired but didnâ€™t place any orders, offering potential for targeted follow-ups.

5. **Order and Discount Trends**:
   - **High-spending Customers**: Identified the top 5 companies by total spending, offering insights for loyalty programs.
   - **Discount Patterns**: Analyzed the correlation between discount frequency and order volume, showing a direct relationship.

6. **Shipping and Cost Analysis**:
   - **Shipping Cost Trends**: Observed that the shipping company with `ship_id 3`, Federal Shipping, has particularly high rates. However, this trend was seasonal, with rates increasing during specific periods.
   - **High Shipping Fees**: Determined that high shipping fees were applied regardless of product type, affecting both fragile and non-fragile items.
   - **Top-paying Companies**: Identified companies that paid the highest shipping fees, highlighting potential inefficiencies.

7. **Order Cancellations**:
   - Analyzed order cancellations and found the USA as the leading country for cancellations. The majority of these cancellations were handled by the carrier with `ship_id 2`, United Package.

8. **Top and Least Selling Products**:
   - Listed the top 5 best-selling and bottom 5 least-selling products, providing insights into product popularity and potential discontinuation.

9. **Revenue Analysis**:
   - **Monthly Revenue**: Calculated monthly revenue to identify sales trends and peak seasons.
   - **Order Quantity vs. Discount Frequency**: Observed that higher discount frequencies were generally associated with higher order quantities.

10. **Inventory Management**:
    - Identified products needing restocking based on order demand, helping optimize stock levels.
